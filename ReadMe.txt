This is the project folder. It is written in PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used XAMPP as a local server to run PHP and queries to the database. You can download the foder and read the code or run it from a local server in your browser. I created two admin accounts, for the admin login:

username: johndoe, password: 1234
username: janedoe, password: 1234

Download the sql file boss_info.sql and import it in your database so you can run it. Then open the file directory from your local server.
